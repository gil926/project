                        A house requires less maintenance than garden plants,<br> although it is extremely important to check what the growing instructions are.<br> Adhere to instructions

                    <p>
                    Of course, there are many benefits to artificial plants that should not be underestimated.<br> However, a comparison between a living plant and a plant 
                    Plastic is like comparing a real dog to a toy dog.<br> The treatment of plants is a fun activity in itself, <br>when 
                    Devoted cultivation leads to results â€“ good growth of the plant.<br> Beyond that, as much as the artificial vegetation will not be 
                    Well, <br>she'll never be able to recreate the natural beauty of well-kept houseplants.

                <h2>How are houseplants different from garden plants?</h2>
                <p>Houseplants usually require relatively little exposure to the sun and the open air.<br> They need a controlled temperature. 
                And balanced, and for a steady supply of water.<br> There are plants that are important to place them near a window,<br> while others are better placed 
                In the shady area of the house.<br> In any case, the home conditions protect more sensitive plants,<br> allowing them to survive 
                Over time, while at the same time making the house happy and decorating the house, <br>Nitzan Nursery provides its customers with a large selection of plants   
                Home,<br> when at the time of purchase, each customer receives precise grooming instructions.</p>
